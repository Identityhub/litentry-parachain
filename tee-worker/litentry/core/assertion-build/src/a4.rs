/// Here's an example of different assertions in this VC:
///
/// Imagine:
/// ALICE holds 100 LITs since 2018-03-02
/// BOB   holds 100 LITs since 2023-03-07
/// CAROL holds 0.1 LITs since 2020-02-22
///
/// min_amount is 1 LIT
///
/// If they all request A4, these are the received assertions:
/// ALICE:
/// [
///    from_date: < 2019-01-01
///    to_date: >= 2023-03-30 (now)
///    value: true
/// ]
///
/// BOB:
/// [
///    from_date: < 2017-01-01
///    to_date: >= 2023-03-30 (now)
///    value: false
/// ]
///
/// CAROL:
/// [
///    from_date: < 2017-01-01
///    to_date: >= 2023-03-30 (now)
///    value: false
/// ]
///
/// So just from the assertion results you can't distinguish between:
/// BOB, who just started to hold recently,
/// and CAROL, who has been holding for 3 years, but with too little amount
///
/// This is because the data provider doesn't provide more information, it only
/// takes the query with from_date and min_ammount, and returns true or false.
///
/// Please note:
/// the operators are mainly for IDHub's parsing, we will **NEVER** have:
/// - `from_date` with >= op, nor
/// - `value` is false but the `from_date` is something other than 2017-01-01.
