The Litentry parachain.


## launch of local dev network

To start dev network locally with 2 relaychain nodes and 1 parachain node:
```
make launch-local-docker
```

## manual builds

To build the litentry-parachain raw binary manually:
```
make build-node
```

To build the litentry-parachain runtime wasm manually:
```
make build-runtime
```
The wasms should be located under `target/release/wbuild/litentry-parachain-runtime/`

To build the litentry/litentry-parachain docker image locally:
```
make build-docker
```

The docker-compose.yml and other files within `generated-dev/` are generated by running
```
make generate-docker-compose-dev
```
Prerequisite: [parachain-launch](https://github.com/open-web3-stack/parachain-launch) must be installed.

To build staging env chain-specs, use `make generate-docker-compose-staging`
staging env doesn't really run the service inside docker container, but the generated chain specs are useful.

The default leasing duration for parachain is 1 day, in case you want to extend it (even after it's downgraded to parathread), simply do a `forceLease` via sudo, it should be upgraded to parachain soon again and start to produce blocks.

## run CI tests locally

To run the CI tests locally, dev network must be launched first as above, then:
```
make test-ci
```
You may want to run `make clean-local-docker` to stop the containers and tidy them.
Please note that this command also removes all local `litentry/litentry-parachain` images except the one with latest tag.
